Diabetes Prediction Model

Diabetes Prediction â€” a reproducible, easy-to-follow repository for training, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning model that predicts diabetes risk from patient features. This README explains how to run the code, train the model, evaluate results, and perform inference.

âœ… Works with a standard CSV dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset) or your own labeled CSV.
ðŸ”§ Implementations provided for scikit-learn (classical ML) and TensorFlow (neural network).
ðŸ“¦ Includes preprocessing, training scripts, evaluation metrics, and a simple inference example.
